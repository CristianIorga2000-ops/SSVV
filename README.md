#  Faculty Work: Software Systems Verification and Validation - Laboratory Exercises

This repository contains the laboratory work for the course Software Systems Verification and Validation. Throughout the course, I plan and organize tests, set up continuous integration with Jenkins, and manage test cases using TestLink. I write automated tests in Java, utilizing testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito for unit testing and mocking. The repository also showcases different types of testing such as white-box testing, black-box testing, and integration testing.
